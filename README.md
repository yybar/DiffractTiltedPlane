This repo contains two python code files DiffractTiltedPlane.py and ImageScienceToolBox.py.  The DiffractTiltedPlane.py calls the ImageScienceClass() from ImageScienceToolBox.py code to create a circular source of size nsamp/padFac.  The diffraction code simulates the diffraction from he source to the tilted plane.  The results indicate the effects of the inverse square law, the distortion of the function in the plane of the tilt, and Fresnel diffraction effects associated with the tilt.
