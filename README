This repository contains DiffractTiltedPlane.py and ImageScienceToolBox.py.  The code contained in DiffractTiltedPlane contains a base class and sub class.  The base class calls the ImageScienceClass in ImageScienceToolBox.py and makes use of ImageScienceClass.pol2cartMat(nsamp,padFac) to create a circular pupil for the modeling in DiffractTiltedPlane.py.  

The DiffractTiltedPlane contains a Fresnel diffraction kernel that propagates a coherent beam from a source to a tilted plane in the far-field.  The Fresnel propagator is not really needed but it included for near-field work too.  The diffraction DFT is modeled as two van der Monde matrix multiplies of the form Hup*source*Hvq.transpose() and the tilted plane is modeled by rotation matrix.  The DFT formalism provides complete flexibility of the Fourier propagator with regards to sampling.  

The cool thing about this code is that partially coherent effects can be modeled by shrinking the source size to a pixel or two and performing an incoherent superposition of irradiance values on the tiled plane.
